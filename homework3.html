  I have been enjoying the process of learning to navigate photoshop. I would love to be able to have more precision with the blur technique. Shallow images seem to allow for more abstraction, and are actually a great prompt for photo-taking because this style of shooting does not require a model or extravagant location. All you need is a camera and then where you choose to focus the camera will create your shallow shot. Deep shots are interesting too, and seem to be ideal for street photography, portrait taking, and other forms of photography that do require the photographer to be more engaged with the world around them. 
	I am eager to see the ways in which I can potentially use photoshop to make deep images feel like they have as much potential for abstraction as shallow images have. Processes like double exposures, which I am already familiar with, hint at the potential for this. Eventually, I would love to learn how to distort deep images and really utilize their depth, perhaps creating the illusion that they are infinitely deep. An artist that comes to mind for me is Andreas Gursky, who uses photoshop to manipulate his images into large scale, deep photos, and which successfully create a feeling of disorientation. It seems that Photoshop is able to give shallow images the qualities of deeper images which is also very interesting to experiment with. I am excited to become more confident in experimentation both with the camera and in Photoshop.
