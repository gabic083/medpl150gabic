  <h1>Gabi Cohen's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>I enjoy consuming various forms of media! Now it’s time to get creative in a digital space. Historically, I
have enjoyed writing short stories and poems. I take portraits of the people who are important to me, and
since we all carry a camera in our pocket, I think it’s very cool that today we are all photographers in
some capacity!
The medium possibilities for art are always changing, and artists seem to adapt to changing technology
with a sense of curiosity.
In the current dialogue about whether developing technology threatens artists, I think it’s important to
remember all the doors it opens for artists.
Most of all, I want to collaborate creatively. I have a creative impulse, but I think being around other
creatives enables me to run with these impulses. I enjoy collaborating because it allows me to move in
new directions I wouldn’t have come to alone. There is also something improvisational about working
with others that keeps me on my toes. When creatives come together, they work synergistically, and the
options are limitless!
When I was a kid, I made much more art than I do now. I oftentimes use being busy or bogged down by
work as a justification for my lack of creation. I also get a lot of imposter syndrome as an artist, especially
when exploring a new medium. I do not agree with this imposter syndrome, and I think it really goes
against my beliefs that artists are not a special category of person, as we are often taught to believe. I felt
this when I wanted to explore photography and almost didn’t pick up a camera because I wasn’t sure I had
the authority to. I’m so glad I decided to take photos anyway. Everyone creates art, either accidentally, as
a child, or intentionally. I think the best art is art that is accessible to everyone, that may even be simple....</p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
<p> For someone raised in the iPhone generation who took a computer class as early as elementary school, I
have more difficulty navigating HTML than you’d expect. Still, it’s cool to learn this language and to see
a very small but foundational element of the digital world we live in. There’s a lot of complaint in New
York City and beyond right now that there aren’t enough “third spaces” for young people. This overlooks
the marvelous third space that we are among the first to have access to: the internet. I think it’s better for
me to learn new skills than to accept my fate as being “bad with technology” and overidentifying with it.
I think it would be a lot easier to set up the site if the subject of the site weren’t myself. Writing a creative
statement is always difficult because you really have to discern what you think and how you feel. This is
something that’s good to grapple with because it also helps to actually put on paper who you see yourself
as (as an artist) and what drives you to create.
It’s such a cool concept that work from this class can be kept on our website, and it’s a skill set I’m sure
I’ll have much use for in the years to come. I still have some difficulty maneuvering HTML, but I think
this was a good entry point.
I have had many spontaneous ideas, even somewhat entrepreneurial ones, where I felt that having the
ability to create a website would have been a good way to actualize the project. Lots of people jump into
projects without having a roadmap ahead of time. I oftentimes let things remain ideas in my head because
the execution of the idea feels too far off and lofty. Having basic web design skills could mitigate this
feeling and allow me to actualize ideas, or at least get the ball rolling.</p>
