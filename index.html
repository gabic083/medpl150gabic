  <h1>Gabi Cohen's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>I enjoy consuming various forms of media! Now it’s time to get creative in a digital space. Historically, I
have enjoyed writing short stories and poems. I take portraits of the people who are important to me, and
since we all carry a camera in our pocket, I think it’s very cool that today we are all photographers in
some capacity!
The medium possibilities for art are always changing, and artists seem to adapt to changing technology
with a sense of curiosity.
In the current dialogue about whether developing technology threatens artists, I think it’s important to
remember all the doors it opens for artists.
Most of all, I want to collaborate creatively. I have a creative impulse, but I think being around other
creatives enables me to run with these impulses. I enjoy collaborating because it allows me to move in
new directions I wouldn’t have come to alone. There is also something improvisational about working
with others that keeps me on my toes. When creatives come together, they work synergistically, and the
options are limitless!
When I was a kid, I made much more art than I do now. I oftentimes use being busy or bogged down by
work as a justification for my lack of creation. I also get a lot of imposter syndrome as an artist, especially
when exploring a new medium. I do not agree with this imposter syndrome, and I think it really goes
against my beliefs that artists are not a special category of person, as we are often taught to believe. I felt
this when I wanted to explore photography and almost didn’t pick up a camera because I wasn’t sure I had
the authority to. I’m so glad I decided to take photos anyway. Everyone creates art, either accidentally, as
a child, or intentionally. I think the best art is art that is accessible to everyone, that may even be simple....</p>
