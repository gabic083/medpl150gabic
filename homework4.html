  <h1>Homework 4: Photomontage Project</h1>

  <h2>Long Distance</h2>

  <p>This photomontage studies the experience of relationships that are obstructed by distance. I used an image of the ocean from Wikimedia Commons as a backdrop for the piece so there would be a canvas of deep blue, the ocean also being a strong image for the felt weight of long distances. For the rest of the photomontage I used both images from Wikimedia Commons and images I took to display the way in which relationships continue to resist distance and all other measures that stand in their way. This issue feels timeless, but also relevant today with the current state of our world, many of us are unable to be with loved ones and technology has been of service to keeping us connected. I tried to add elements of a FaceTime call to the photomontage to resemble that the piece itself is an incoming call for a distant loved one.

  <h2>Subway</h2>

  <p>This piece is about the way many of us experience a sort of haze from the role technology plays in our lives. Moments like the fluorescently lit subway may evoke the kind of disorientation many of us feel in a time when we are deeply reliant on our phones. It always interests me to be on the subway and see that many others, like me, are on their device, or are perhaps sleeping. There is a collective fatigue I often feel and this piece, with an array of alarms set to “wake up” and the glitchy disorientation of the subway, is meant to explore the disorientation of our current day.
