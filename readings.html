<h2>Reflection on Susan Sontag's “In Plato's Cave”</h2>
<p>
  I like Susan Sontag’s insight on how anyone today can be a photographer, just by carrying a camera. This feels even more true today than in 1977 when it was written. I wonder what Susan Sontag would say today about our image-saturated world and the increasing difficulty to discern what’s real and what isn’t. I think she would bring a critical nuance to the conversation because, to Sontag, a photograph is inherently an appropriation, and to her, this isn’t a new concept. Photography has been manipulating our senses and emotions since the earliest invention of the camera. But this manipulation doesn't necessarily have a negative connotation.
	I am particularly interested in the role photography plays in desire and intimacy. Sontag makes poignant observations about the role of the camera in family dynamics. She notes that it is not the precise content of the moment that is relevant but the choice to take a significant photograph, and that it could almost be assumed that a parent who cares is one who photographs their child, and vice versa. 
Sontag takes note of “the sense of the unattainable that can be evoked by photographs (which) feeds directly into the erotic feelings of those for whom desirability is enhanced by distance” (Sontag 16). I am interested in relationships of all kinds, particularly in those obstructed by distance. I think it would be fascinating to focus a project around the “talismanic uses of photographs” (Sontag 16), as Sontag observes. I think I would be inspired to focus a project around relationships, particularly the relationships obstructed by distance due to current world events, as I have observed many friends experiencing firsthand.
	"Crushed hopes, youth antics, colonial wars, and winter sports are alike—are equalized by the camera. Taking photographs has set up a chronic voyeuristic relation to the world, which levels the meaning of all events” (Sontag 10). I’m interested in the ways in which this equalizing aspect of photography has an emotional impact on the viewer. Photo series that take place in the same location but capture starkly different moments come to mind. The contradiction between photos all taken within the same space does not equalize them in a way that makes them less compelling but actually is more moving because of its juxtaposition and the ability of one space to hold different human experiences. Even in photo series that are not centered in the same location, it is interesting to see how the order and content of vastly different photographs can be compelling when they are placed in context with each other. I think it would be interesting to explore a photo series of this sort. 
	When Sontag talks about immediacy, I think of street photography and how intimate it is between the photographer and the subject of the chosen Event. Approaching people may be daunting, and I think people generally become quite self-conscious when you ask to take their picture, in part, because they know you’ve sought them out and, as Sontag puts it, determined that they are the critical “Event”. In a world where we are surrounded by images not only of others but also of ourselves, there is a paranoia that the camera brings and a fear of surveillance. For that reason, there is an even more heightened sense of intimacy in street photography, and consensual street photography adds an element of recognition of the camera that I find interesting, almost breaking the fourth wall, as you can feel the acknowledgment of the dynamic created by the camera.

<h2>Reflection on Nesrine Malik’s “AI Slop”</h2>
<p> 
Nesrine Malik’s article on “AI slop” describes the nausea and disorientation felt in the new reign of AI-generated content but also seems to assume that we have fallen from a place of visual purity and ultimate truths that I think someone like Susan Sontag or Michel Foucault may take exception to. I think that Malik makes keen observations, both about the attention economy, which I myself have felt greatly impacted by, and also about far-right nostalgia. “Trad-wife” content is one manifestation of this, and Malik interestingly notes that “...’generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic.’ Generative AI is trained on pre-existing data, which research has shown is inherently biased against ethnic diversity, progressive gender roles, and sexual orientations, therefore concentrating those norms in the output” (Malik). But the tone of this article also has a noticeable longing for a time in which both written and visual content was “true.” There is an argument to be made that this is equally as nostalgic as the conservative nostalgia she rightfully is averse to. 
	 I have been interested in the work of Michel Foucault. He might invert the question and ask if truth was ever pure in the way Malik envisions. Susan Sontag made similar remarks in her essay “In Plato’s Cave,” saying, “It is a nostalgic time right now, and photographs actively promote nostalgia. Photography is an elegiac art, a twilight art. Most subjects photographed are, just by virtue of being photographed, touched with pathos. Most subjects photographed are, just by virtue of being photographed, touched with pathos. A photograph is both a pseudo-presence and a token of absence” (Sontag 15). Sontag wrote extensively on the nature of photographs as taking on their own power as both emblems of the past and something fluid and independent of the context in which they were taken. What Malik is impacted by is the emotional manipulation and powerful influence of images. She feels this in an immediate way surface in protectiveness over her mother as she observes her elderly mother's susceptibility to AI-generated content shared on WhatsApp. She is worried about her mother receiving misinformation as a form of manipulation of her mother's mind. “AI Slop” has made its way into our lives and, in a very personal way, into our family lives. It is possible Malik feels nostalgia for a time in which her mother was not as vulnerable to these sorts of illusions, but perhaps there is also an idealization of a time when the news her mother received was completely free of illusions, which I am resistant to and think is worth interrogating. 
	“AI Slop” is evidently a successful outlet for repressed feelings, hatred, resentment, forbidden and withheld desires, and nostalgia, and it has flooded the internet. Fascism seems to emerge from this sort of repression and attempts to congeal with purity, authoritative power, and fear. Social media and our devices themselves take on a role of authority in our lives that feels inescapable. The fact that “AI Slop” is handed to us on the golden platter of our smartphones wields undeniable power. The synergy of these factors places us in this strange, fragile state. In these times I think it’s important to bear in mind that we have not been catapulted to another planet of media, but that advancements in technology enable a loud reverberation of repression of the past to release itself full-throttle.

<h2>Reflection on Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</h2>
<p>
	I found Kadiatu’s story, “The Grieving Mother” in The Devil at My Door compelling in large part because of the content itself, but also because of the medium it was told through. Although I am not an avid reader of graphic novels, illustration does something intriguing in storytelling: it adds emotional dissonance. Perhaps it is because I mainly watched and read storybooks and illustrations of a light subject matter growing up that addressing the topic of grief and motherhood through illustration creates a sort of cognitive dissonance that I imagine Kadiatu’s experience entailed.
When dialogue is written in an illustration format, it creates the sense that these experiences took place within a script. It is almost like the experience of trauma, where you are watching from outside the story or as someone in the audience. Simultaneously, the narrative and content of the story are emotionally evocative. In a way, using the illustration medium to tell this story is poignant because it creates a sense of distance between Kadiatu’s inner and outer world. The overarching text is intense, but the dialogue chosen feels abbreviated and almost like a caricature of what really happened. This caricature often feels more true to the experience itself than a more “realistic” version would. The potent but minimal use of dialogue is reminiscent of the way trauma lives in vague, simple, but memorable moments. It is often not where one would assume the trauma is stored, but it lives there in an unexpected way that a graphic novel is able to capture very well.
Where a written story may do justice to Kadiatu’s experience, something about the illustration medium seems to do more justice to the experience of memory, to Kadiatu’s lived experience of recollection and reflection. The illustration medium to me always creates a sense of “breaking the fourth wall,” and that may be because it is not trying to be as realistic as possible. The simplicity and style of graphic illustration know their shortcomings and embrace them, and this to me has always created an intimate feeling as a viewer. I am also realizing that the format of illustration creates a sense of distance, and for me it seems like the perfect medium through which to observe the past, because of the way memory functions, which has sharp moments of intimacy but with an overall sensation of distance and being very far removed.
This tension between distance and intimacy in illustrated storytelling reminded me of other works that explore trauma in similar ways. My first experience with illustration as an art form that serves this function was the show Bojack Horseman. Despite its dark humor, the show displayed intense realities through animation, and this took place in a way I found unexpected at the time. My second experience with unexpected illustration was Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home. Dark humor itself is another example of the way both dark humor and graphic art fit this “medium is the message.” Dark humor points directly at our suffering, and this is amplified through its contrast. In the same way, memories are distorted; they are outlines of the past, not crystal clear, and morph into something entirely their own that is more than what they claim to depict. Using illustration is in no way merely “ironic”; it feels more truthful and in many cases more capable of capturing the experience of memory and trauma.
