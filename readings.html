  I like Susan Sontag’s insight on how anyone today can be a photographer, just by carrying a camera. This feels even more true today than in 1977 when it was written. I wonder what Susan Sontag would say today about our image-saturated world and the increasing difficulty to discern what’s real and what isn’t. I think she would bring a critical nuance to the conversation because, to Sontag, a photograph is inherently an appropriation, and to her, this isn’t a new concept. Photography has been manipulating our senses and emotions since the earliest invention of the camera. But this manipulation doesn't necessarily have a negative connotation.
	I am particularly interested in the role photography plays in desire and intimacy. Sontag makes poignant observations about the role of the camera in family dynamics. She notes that it is not the precise content of the moment that is relevant but the choice to take a significant photograph, and that it could almost be assumed that a parent who cares is one who photographs their child, and vice versa. 
Sontag takes note of “the sense of the unattainable that can be evoked by photographs (which) feeds directly into the erotic feelings of those for whom desirability is enhanced by distance” (Sontag 16). I am interested in relationships of all kinds, particularly in those obstructed by distance. I think it would be fascinating to focus a project around the “talismanic uses of photographs” (Sontag 16), as Sontag observes. I think I would be inspired to focus a project around relationships, particularly the relationships obstructed by distance due to current world events, as I have observed many friends experiencing firsthand.
	"Crushed hopes, youth antics, colonial wars, and winter sports are alike—are equalized by the camera. Taking photographs has set up a chronic voyeuristic relation to the world, which levels the meaning of all events” (Sontag 10). I’m interested in the ways in which this equalizing aspect of photography has an emotional impact on the viewer. Photo series that take place in the same location but capture starkly different moments come to mind. The contradiction between photos all taken within the same space does not equalize them in a way that makes them less compelling but actually is more moving because of its juxtaposition and the ability of one space to hold different human experiences. Even in photo series that are not centered in the same location, it is interesting to see how the order and content of vastly different photographs can be compelling when they are placed in context with each other. I think it would be interesting to explore a photo series of this sort. 
	When Sontag talks about immediacy, I think of street photography and how intimate it is between the photographer and the subject of the chosen Event. Approaching people may be daunting, and I think people generally become quite self-conscious when you ask to take their picture, in part, because they know you’ve sought them out and, as Sontag puts it, determined that they are the critical “Event”. In a world where we are surrounded by images not only of others but also of ourselves, there is a paranoia that the camera brings and a fear of surveillance. For that reason, there is an even more heightened sense of intimacy in street photography, and consensual street photography adds an element of recognition of the camera that I find interesting, almost breaking the fourth wall, as you can feel the acknowledgment of the dynamic created by the camera.
